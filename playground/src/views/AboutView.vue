    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
      This webpage is a playground for the Pixel Language. The compiler was initially developed as
      part of an assignment for a
      <a class="link-green" href="https://www.um.edu.mt/courses/studyunit/CPS2000"
        >course on Compiler Design</a
      >
      while I was studying for a Bachelors in Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Pixel language is Turing complete, imperative and has builtins for interacting with a
      graphical display. This allows the Pixel programmer to easily write programs that produce
      interesting visuals and also makes Pixel appealing as a toy language.
    </p>

    <p>A full specification of the Pixel language is given below.</p>

    <p>
      Pixel is intended to be compiled down to an intermediate representation (IR) for a stack-based
      virtual machine (VM) referred to as the Pixel VM. The VM state includes a graphical display
      and opcodes are provided for manipulating this display.
    </p>

    <p>A full specification of the Pixel VM is given below.</p>

    <h1>Pixel Language Specification</h1>

    <h2>Syntax</h2>

    <!-- BNF -->

    <h2>Semantics</h2>

    Many constructs in Pixel are similar to C or other imperative languages, and their semantics can
    therefore be inferred readily. This section is therefore not an attempt to accurately and
    completely describe all the semantics of Pixel, but instead focuses on an informal description
    of the more idiosyncratic of Pixel's semantics.

    <!-- Display features, delay, print -->
    <!-- Main function -->
    <!-- Nested functions, functions are not first class -->
    <!-- Numerical semantics -->

    <h1>Pixel VM Specification</h1>

    <h2>Pixel VM State</h2>

    <p>The Pixel VM state consists of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A work stack used in any computation</li>
      <li>A call stack which tracks function calls</li>
      <li>A frame stack which is used to manage scopes</li>
      <li>A graphical display with a fixed width and height</li>
      <li>A log which is used for output</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The work stack is used when computing values. It can only be accessed as a stack; in
      particular the program cannot see beyond the topmost element without first popping it off the
      stack.
    </p>

    <p>
      The call stack is used whenever a function call or a return needs to be executed. Each item in
      the stack consists of a local (function-specific) instruction pointer (also called program
      counter or PC), and a reference to the function itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a function is called, an item containing a reference to the called function is pushed to
      the stack (with the local PC initialized to 0).
    </p>

    <p>
      When a <span class="code">ret</span> opcode needs to be executed, the topmost item is simply
      popped from the call stack.
    </p>

    <p>
      It should be clear from this description that the topmost item of the call stack acts as a
      sort of global PC, as it contains the current function, as well as a local PC within that
      function. The use of a frame stack instead of a single global PC allows us to avoid needing
      some sort of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention" class="link-green"
        >&quot;calling convention&quot;</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      The frame stack consists of frames. Each frame is a resizable array of memory locations. A
      program can use the <span class="code">push</span> opcode to load a value from a memory
      location in any frame in the stack. Without this functionality the Pixel VM would not be
      Turing complete, as its memory would be limited to the work stack. (Perhaps this is not
      entirely true; since one could write a program that uses the Pixel VM display as indexable
      memory.)
    </p>

    <p>
      New frames are created by the <span class="code">call</span> or
      <span class="code">oframe</span> opcodes. New frames will be pushed onto the frame stack.
    </p>

    <p>
      Frames are meant to correspond to scopes in the Pixel language; the Pixel compiler generates
      code that creates new frames when entering control blocks such as an
      <span class="code">if</span> or <span class="code">for</span> statement.
    </p>

    <p>The top frame can be resized using the <span class="code">alloc</span> opcode.</p>

    <p>
      Frames can be popped off the frame stack and destroyed using the
      <span class="code">ret</span> or the <span class="code">cframe</span> opcodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The display is used to output graphics. The <span class="code">read</span> opcode can be used
      to read a pixel on the display. The <span class="code">pixel</span> and
      <span class="code">pixelr</span> opcodes can be used to colour pixels on the display. It is
      assumed that the display's width and height do not change during execution of a program.
    </p>

    <h2>Data types</h2>

    <p>Each item in the work or frame stack has one of the following types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An IEEE754 floating point number.</li>
      <li>A colour (encoded as a hex string, e.g. <span class="code">#7f5612</span>)</li>
      <li>
        An instruction pointer which specifies the offset of some instruction within the current
        function. When a <span class="code">push</span> instruction with a PC relative offset (e.g.
        <span class="code">#PC+9</span>) is executed, the PC relative offset is converted into an
        instruction pointer before pushing onto the work stack. This is necessary since the PC
        relative offset is specified relative to the current PC, which will change by the time we
        actually use the offset.
      </li>
      <li>
        A reference to a function (encoded as a function label, e.g.
        <span class="code">.main</span>)
      </li>
      <li>A pointer to an array of one of the above data types (or another array type)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Memory locations within a frame or an array can also contain a special
      <span class="code">undefined</span> value, meaning they have not yet been initialized.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both the work stack and the frame stack are untyped, meaning any location within them can
      contain a value of any type. Each opcode requires the items it pops from the work stack to
      have a certain type; if one of these expectations is violated, the VM will crash with a type
      error. The expected types for each opcode are tabulated below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Booleans can be encoded as numbers. The logical opcodes treat any non-zero number as true and
      zero as false.
    </p>

    <h2>Opcodes</h2>

    <p>The following is a comprehensize list of opcodes which are supported by the Pixel VM:</p>
