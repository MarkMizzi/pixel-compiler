# Pixel Playground

This is a playground app for the Pixel language, compiler and runtime.

## Development

You can build and run the webapp for development using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the application, which can then be accessed in a browser on the same machine at the url http://localhost:8080. The application will be reloaded as you change your code.

## Building

You can build the web app by running

```bash
npm run build
```

However the playground is designed to be run inside a Docker container (see [here](../README.md)).
